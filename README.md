# Adaptive-Vertical-and-Horizontal-Orientation-List
 In Flutter, you can build different layouts depending on a given Orientation. In this example, build a list that displays column in portrait mode and column in landscape mode


In some situations, you want to update the display of an app when the user rotates the screen from portrait mode to landscape mode. For example, the app might show one item after the next in portrait mode, yet put those same items side-by-side in landscape mode.
